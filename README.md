# SteelDefectsDetection_CNN
This project focuses on automating quality inspection in steel manufacturing by detecting surface cracks in steel plates using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
Manual inspection is time-consuming, subjective, and prone to errors. The proposed system uses deep learning to identify surface defects from high-resolution images, helping reduce defects and enabling predictive maintenance in industrial settings.
